A continuation of the abandoned "ZMM More Variants Updated". [i]No, the irony is not lost on me.[/i]

Allows the creation of variants for any equipment and extends the limit to 99 in most cases.
I did not alter the cost, however, so I'd recommend you to run this alongside mods like my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997147106] 1M Army XP[/url].

[b] HoI IV Version[/b]: 1.11

[b] Compatibility[/b]: This only works with mods that don't alter the tech tree too much.
- "Kaiserreich" works
- "Apr√©s moi le deluge" works
- Add Technologies partially works
- "Road to 56" doesn't work
- "TNO" doesn't work
- "Millenium Dawn" doesn't work

You can request me to make compatible versions of your favourite total conversion mod, but I will make/update versions for the ones above myself over time, anyways.

[b] Languages[/b]:
- English
- German
-(partially) Russian

All other languages get the English names and descriptions but feel free to send me the translated localization files for your native language, so I can add them.
