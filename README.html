A continuation of the abandoned "ZMM More Variants Updated". No, the irony is not lost on me.

[b] Version [/b]: 1.11

Allows the creation of variants for any equipment and extends the limit to 99 in most cases.

I did not alter the cost, however, so I'd recommend you to run this alongside mods like my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997147106] 1M Army XP [/url]

[b] Compatibility [/b]: This only works with mods that don't alter the tech tree by much. 
- Kaiserreich works
- Road to 56 doesn't work
