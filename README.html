A continuation of the abandoned "ZMM More Variants Updated". No, the irony is not lost on me.

Allows the creation of variants for any equipment and extends the limit to 99 in most cases.

I did not alter the cost, however, so I'd recommend you to run this alongside mods like my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997147106] 1M Army XP [/url]

[b] HoI IV Version [/b]: 1.11

[b] Compatibility [/b]: This only works with mods that don't alter the tech tree too much. 
- "Kaiserreich" works
- "Apr√©s mas le deluge" works
- Add Technologies partially works
- "Road to 56" doesn't work
- "TNO" doesn't work
- "Millenium Dawn" doesn't work

You can ask for me to make compatible versions of your favourite total conversion mod, but I will make/update versions for the ones above myself over time, anyways.

[b] Languages [/b]:
- English
- German
-(partially) Russian
All other languages get the English names and descriptions, but feel free to send me the translated localization files for your native language, so I can add them.
